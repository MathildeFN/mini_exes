**Describe how does your game/game object work:**

I have created a “game” called “Let it snow” – by clicking the button on the screen, you can make it snow even more – the more you click the button, the more snow will appear.

**Describe how you program the objects and their related attributes and methods in your game:**

To create my game object, I started to create to variables: “snow” and “button”, because these were the two elements I wanted to be represented on the screen. Then I created a canvas and the clickable button and called it “Let it snow”. Then I defined my variable “snow”, by naming its color, speed, positions and size. I also defined my objects methods (that it should be able to snow, and be displayed) and the function of the button (that by clicking it, more snow will appear). Then I created a Class called “Snow”, where to I have created a constructor to define my object; its color, speed, positions and size and described its related attributes and methods.

**Based on Shiftman's videos, Lee's text and in-class lecture, what are the characteristics of object-oriented programming?**

Objects are designed to manage data and carry out operations. Object oriented programming allows creation of objects that represent only a part of the real-world objects. It describes the “outside view” of an object, and the objects inner working, or encapsulated information. 
In computer programming, an object is an entity with attributes, that belong to and describes it. These attributes can be actions which the object is capable of performing, and interface to access those attributes and actions and a unique identity.
An object is a specific instance of a class, which can be thought of as a blueprint for that object - each object has a unique identity. Objects are able to both change states and react to state changes through methods. An object's constructor is the actual method that handles the creation and initialization of the object, it physically places that object into the computer's memory.
A class is the concept behind an object, while an object itself is a physical entity with a place in space and time. Objects depends on its class which means that the object couldn’t exist without the class that it is derived from – so the class must be defined before the object can even be conceived.

**Extend/connect your game project to wider digital culture context, can you think of a digital example and describe how complex details and operations are being abstracted and encapsulated?**

When creating my game project, I began to think of the difference between writing code and seeing the result of the code, which made me think of the visibility and invisibility of the digital culture. What I find interesting about the wider digital culture is that it to me seems like a two-layered world, one visible and the other invisible to most people. There is the layer visible to everyone - the interfaces we meet all the time, with a bunch of options for us to interact with. The invisible layer is what is happening behind the screen – all the codes, that enables the different programs to work. The visible layer seems simple and understandable to most people, and there is often a bunch of signifiers telling you how to interact with the screen. The other lay, consisting all the codes behind the program, is more invisible and much more complex for most people who isn’t familiar with programming and coding. I find this invisibility interesting, because it seems to me that the programmers and coders are having a lot of power and control of other people’s life and our societies, since they got the power to control how things works, and what we are allowed to see, and what we are able to do with our digital artefacts. In connection of that, it is interesting to think about, who those powerful people are – what kind of people they are, and which interest they might take. The fact that these leading programmers mostly are white men, makes it interesting to think about, how and if that has an impact on how the world looks like today, and how the world would look like if it instead of white men, was leaded by women and maybe with another skin color as well?
