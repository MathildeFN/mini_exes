Describtion of my coding process

My first independent coding process consisted a lot of frustrations and lack of understanding, but at the same time I really wanted to learn and figure out, how to program and code, and about which possibilities it would open up for me.
My first independent coding process was then primary about understand and figuring out how coding works and what I would be able to do with it. The first thing I did, was to go to p5.js to read about the different references. I started to study shapes, colors, backgrounds and rotations. I started to copy the simple codes from the reference list and past it into the Atom program. After that I started to modify the different syntaxes, so they got the shapes, sizes and placements I 
wanted them to have. My goal was to create figures in movement, an be able to decide which colors the background and the different figures should have.  In the process of modifying the codes I felt a lot of frustration, when the result of my writing was not consistent with my intentions. When they finally confirmed to my intentions, I felt a big relief and a bit of pride as well by completing my goals. 

Coding vs. reading and writing

If you compare my coding process with reading and writing I would say that there is both similarities and differences. The clear difference between coding and writing is of cause the language. The language of coding is kind of mathematic and it won’t make sense to the computer or program, if it isn’t written exact, whereas common writing is more humanistic and is mostly understandable even though the gramma might not be exact. Regarding the reading part, I see some clear differences as well; from my point of view, reading codes can be read both as the coding text, but also by the creations that comes out of the codes, whereas common reading only can be read by the text on the paper/screen, unless you consider the possibility to read between the lines, and view that as the result/or code of the common writing.  The similarities between these to are, as I se it, that both is about having an attention to write or create something, which you illustrate through its matching language. 

The potential and possibilities of codeing practice

Regarding the protentional and possibilities of coding practice, I started to get an idea of why programming would be a great skill to learn, and what you would be able to do with it, by reading the text “Why programing”. I figured that programming allows you to think and consider questions to care about in new ways. Constructions of computational models might help you consider these questions in other ways and enables groups to discuss these new perspectives with a common reference to argue with and to edit.
I also figured that programming offers a better understanding of culture and media systems. By understanding how these media systems are programmed, you gain an insight of the designer’s intentions and all the different things that has influenced it. A full understanding of some of these media systems will both involve an understanding of the decisions made by the developer, but also the decisions made in creating and upgrading the underlying technologies.
