**Temperature and humidity in Aarhus**

I have made this program in collaboration with Cathrine B. P.

**•	What is the program about?**

Our program consists of two circles; one illustrating the temperature by changing color between red and blue, where blue represent that it is very cold and red that it is very warm. The other circle indicates the humidity by changing between light to dark grey scale, where a dark grey indicates a high humidity and a light grey indicates low humidity. 
We had a very hard time creating this program, so to create out program we ended up using one of Daniel Shiftmann’s tutorials and redesign it. Therefore, we have used same API has he did, namely the Open Weather API – which also seemed easy to understand how to use. 

**•	Describtion and reflection** 

This process of making this mini exercise was very hard and difficult. At first, I found it very difficult to even understand what API was, and how you could use it, but after working with it hands on, it now seems a bit clearer to me what it is and what you can use it for. I think it is cool that you by loading an URL, APIkey and ID, can get access to data from a webpage, which you can use, modify and represent they way you want to in your program. Regarding to how much I understand this provided data, I think I’m getting closer to understand those, and how API enables others to use and modify other webpages data. Regarding the way platform providers sort the data and give us the selected data, I think…
I find it interesting how platform providers sort the data, and only give you the selected, because it illustrates the power of these platforms, how they can chose which data should be shown and which not.

**•Web APIs or querying processes to investigate further**

When I get more time to investigate these web API’s or querying processes, I think it would be interesting to investigate if you maybe can use and combine different web API’s and create something interesting out of the combination of different data.
